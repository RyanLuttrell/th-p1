        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Software and web development have been a passion of mine for the last 6-months. After completing my first Tech Degree, I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life!</p>
        <p>Now, it's all about learning as much as I can so that I can break into the amazing world of tech!</p>
